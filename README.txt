WebDev Examples

To encourage better development tools and better ways of comparing both tools and approaches to development, this repo has focused user-experience test cases. 

Each leaf directory should have an index.html or other simple entry point. 

Most cases should be minimal so readers and tool developers can focus on a single critical issue.
